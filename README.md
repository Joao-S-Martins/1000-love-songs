# 1000 Love Songs
My goal is to write 1000 love songs, inspired by my wife, children, our families, friends, and all the best moments of the human experience.

## Dedication
I dedicate these works to my lovely wife and our amazing children. And to our wonderful families and bounty of friends. And for all the people and events that have paved and shaped our journeys on this Earth. But most of all, to God, whom I hope to meet and thank. May I be the best version of myself that He intended me to be. #blessed

## Contribute
I welcome opportunities to collaborate on songs. I also welcome corrections to errors that aren't an intentional part of my songs.

I've always loved to hear how different artists cover/re-imagine songs. I'd love to share your original score or recording of my songs as part of this project.

## License
I'm still trying to figure this out. I expect the final license to allow my works to be freely performed in the spirit of spreading love in this world, but preserve my rights to collect licensing fees from those who intend to profit from my art. Ideally, to spread free love and share in the wealth.

At the present time, contact me directly with all licensing requests.
