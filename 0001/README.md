# Title
Wakin Next to You

## Lyrics
To travel the world
seeing its sights.
Supersonic speeds,
private jet flights.
The seventh game of,
World Series ball.
The thrill of winning
a cash windfall.
And as time rolls, on for us all
Nothing compares to,
when I wake next to you.
When I wake next to you.

The flow of the tides,
turn of the Earth.
The crowning of kings,
a prince's birth.
The changing of leaves,
Springtime to Fall.
All the birds singing,
a mating call.
And as time rolls, on for us all
Nothing compares to,
when I wake next to you.
When I wake next to you.

The stars came to form,
planets took shape.
A fish learned to walk,
across landscape.
Meteor showers,
solar eclipse.
Some red and blue moons.
All lead to this.
Even if time, ceased to exist
Nothing compares to,
when I wake next to you.
When I wake next to you.

It's all lead us to this.
Even if time, ceases to exist
Nothing compares to,
waking next to you.
